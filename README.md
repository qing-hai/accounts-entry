# accounts-entry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Differential/accounts-entry.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Differential/accounts-entry)

A meteorite package that relies on Iron Router and provides an
alternative interface to accounts-ui.  This package has whole pages for sign up, sign in, and forgotten password.

We wanted something to work with that used [Iron Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router),
[Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/mangasocial/meteor-bootstrap-3), and didn't require the forcing of
the dropdown box that didn't seem to be easily styled. But we love the ease of adding more packages like `accounts-facebook` or `accounts-twitter`, so we fully support the OAuth packages by adding buttons to let people sign-up/sign-in with those services if you add them.  We also supports the `accounts-password` package if you add it.
