# accounts-entry

A meteorite package that relies on Iron Router and provides an
alternative interface to accounts-ui, with whole pages for sign up
and sign in. 

We wanted something to work with that used [Iron Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router),
[Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/mangasocial/meteor-bootstrap-3), and didn't require the forcing of
the dropdown box that didn't seem to be easily styled. But we love the ease of adding more packages like `accounts-facebook` or `accounts-twitter`, so we fully support the OAuth packages by adding buttons to let people sign-up/sign-in with those services if you add them.  Right now it also assumes you will be using `accounts-password`, but we will likely make that optional in the future.

Examples of the package in action (check out the sign up or sign in
links):

* https://carp.io/
* https://getliquid.io/
* http://support.unpolishedcr.com/
* Email team@differential.io to add your project to the list.
